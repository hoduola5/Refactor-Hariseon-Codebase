# Refactor-Hariseon-Codebase

## Description

Refactor-Hariseon-Codebase is a landing page for Horiseon. I'm motivated to do this so as to ensure that people with disabilities can access the website using assistive technologies such as video captions, screen readers, and braille keyboards by making it more cleaner than I found it to follow Scout Rule, which recommends that you always leave the code a little cleaner than when you found it.

## Usage

Copy this link "https://hoduola5.github.io/Refactor-Hariseon-Codebase/" from the README, paste on the browser and fand navigate around it.

Here is the screenshot of what the form look like:
